# FaceDetection
Face detection using Azure services.
The goal of this project is to detect and locate human faces in a color image. Face detection is a sub-process of facial recognition, but the term typically refers to image-based face recognition where only the locations of faces in an image are used to identify or verify a person, while facial recognition also creates a model of their unique face, which is then matched to a target face.
Face detection improves surveillance efforts and helps track down criminals and terrorists. Personal security is also enhanced since there is nothing for hackers to steal or change, such as passwords.

Azure Services Used : Azure machine learning, Azure cognitive services, Computer vision, Key vault & Application insights.
